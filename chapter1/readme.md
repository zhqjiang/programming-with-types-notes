# Chapter 1 Introduction to typing

## 1.4 Types of type systems

### 1.4.1 Dynamic and static typing

With static typing, type checking is performed at compile time. Dynamic typing, on the other hand, defers type checking to the run time, so type mismatches become run-time error.

Dynamic typing does not impose any typing constraints at compile time.

### 1.4.2 Weak and strong typing

Note that although a type system is either dynamic (type checking at run time) or static(type checking at compile time), its strength lies on a spectrum: the more **_implicit conversions_** it performs, the weaker it is.
